{"text": "Engineering multinational, Arup, has released a report entitled “It’s Alive,” which explores how urban buildings could look by 2050 &ndash; essentially functional living organisms, that are constantly changing to respond to environmental changes and user demands. It predicts structures that are fully integrated into the fabric of a city, able to respond to external environment changes and designed for continuous adaptability. There are predictions of jet-powered maintenance robots, high-rise farms, and photovoltaic paint, all of which are already in development. The predictions include modular skyscrapers that are maintained by drones, are fuel efficient thanks to algae fuel cells and have a brain-like “intelligent building system” that can make automatic adjustments to the needs of the inhabitants to deliver more resources than they consume.", "label": 1}

One recommendation is to hide spoons in their underwear (as metal objects) that will trigger security alarms and result in them being taken away from their parents to be searched. Victims will then have a “last chance to seek help from airport staff.” Birmingham, Glasgow, London Heathrow, and Liverpool airports are working with Karma Nirvana to identify potential red flags to spot potential victims. This year, Britain’s Forced Marriage Unit has already dealt with some 1,500 cases across 60 countries, and officials fear this is just the tip of the iceberg, with few community leaders willing to speak out and risk losing support.\n", "label": 1}

Researchers have created a seven-point checklist of factors to designate a family as a ‘problem,’ with a family needing to fit five or more to fall into the category. Such families often struggle to afford basic needs and require police intervention.

So, your body grows baby teeth to help you chew food, learn how to speak, and keep your jaw healthy. Once you are about six years old, your mouth becomes big enough to make room for adult teeth. So, your baby teeth start to fall out, which allows new, bigger teeth to grow in their place. \n\nAdult teeth are different from baby teeth because they are stronger and bigger. They are designed to last a lifetime, so it's important to take good care of them.

So, declaring bankruptcy can be a way for them to start fresh and have a chance to pay back what they can, instead of being stuck with a big debt forever.", "label": 1}

In addition, low inflation means lower payments by the government on index-linked debt, and lower increases on certain benefits, which could free more cash for schools, hospitals and police. Mr Osborne could also use the extra cash to offer more wiggle room in meeting deficit-reduction plans.
